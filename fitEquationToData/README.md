# Data Fitting 
# Motivation
The goal of this project is to fit a given dataset using the SciPy library and impementing the fit myself. Both fits result in the same values for the variables.

# Theory

Given a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. Here, a variable $x$ has a log-normal distribution if $\log(x)$ is normally distributed. The probability density function for the log-normal distribution is

$$
p(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma x \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{\left(-\frac{(\ln(x)-\mu)^2}{2 \sigma ^2}\right)}
$$

 Hence, in order to compute a lognormal distribution, I first compute the logarithmic mean
$$
\bar{x}_\text{log} = \ln(\mu) - 0.5 \, \sigma ^2
$$

and then use the numpy module to create lognormal distributions

The I calculate the deviation and use the SciPy function optimize.minimize to decrease the deviation and find the correct values for sigman and Âµ (here the Nelder Mead method of that function is used).
