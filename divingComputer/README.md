# Diving Computer
# Motivation
In this project the goal is to read in and work with data from .xlsx tables using pandas. The data is then used to calculate the maximum bottom time for the 2nd dive of one day at a given depths. Morover the residual nitrogen time is given (equals to the amout of time considered as already spent at a certain depth for the 2nd dive).

# Dive Theory

 to get rid of the excessive nitrogen in the blood and body tissue
